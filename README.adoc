== June 11: Lab 5. Finish up prior labs, and try this out for kicks

=== Preliminaries

Perform static analysis of Java code.

. http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php[Download and install Graphviz]
. Fork and clone https://github.com/lawrancej/jdt-project[jdt-project].
. Next, add +JAVA_HOME+ to your environment variables:
+
Windows: Search for "environment variables" and click 'Edit the system environment variables'. Click 'Environment Variables...' -> 'New...'
+
Variable name: +JAVA_HOME+
+
Variable value: +C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_05+ (or whatever version you're using)
. Click OK, OK, OK.
+
Close and reopen Git Bash. If you get the same error, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8&feature=kp[try turning it off and on again]
. Import the project into eclipse.
+
----
git clone git@github.com:lawrancej/jdt-project.git
cd jdt-project
./gradlew eclipse
----
+
'File' -> 'Import' -> 'General' -> 'Existing projects into workspace'
. Read through the code. Open +Main+ and run it. Nothing will happen. You'll need to supply the root folder of a Java project to +main+.
+
Go to 'Run Configurations' -> 'Main' -> 'Arguments' -> 'Program arguments'. Enter the path to a Java project. Click 'Run'. If you have no other Java projects, you can supply the source of +jdt-project+ to itself. Huzzah!
. Modify AstVisitor to do one of the following (pick one):

=== Lab (choose your own adventure)

Modify ASTVisitor subclass to do something interesting.

http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FASTVisitor.html[Documentation for ASTVisitor]

For example:

* Generate UML class diagram for source code (Show members of classes) http://www.graphviz.org/content/datastruct[See this for insipration]
* Generate a graph of class dependencies (Type uses Types) http://www.graphviz.org/content/softmaint[See this for inspiration]
* Generate a graph of package dependencies (Package uses Packages)
* Generate a graph of method dependencies (Method uses Methods)
* Generate a graph of class inheritance / interface implementation
* Suggest some other graph-related static analysis


== June 10: Midterm practice?

Pull from me: `git pull upstream master`

Take a look at an old midterm for practice purposes: `start exams/Midterm1.pdf`

Had any difficulty? Let's discuss.

Bootstrapping::
Making a compiler "self-hosting" so that the compiler can be https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf[written in the language it compiles].
The first C compiler was written in a different language.

Nondeterminism::
Having more than one option about which state to visit next.

Ambiguity::
Having more than one parse tree for a given input.

== June 8: SSA and GC

=== Single static assignment (SSA) Form

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form[SSA] is a transformation on code that is a prerequisite for many low-level optimizations, such as dead/duplicate code elimination.
Think of it like version control for variables.
Each variable gets a new version number when an assignment is made, hence single assignment.
If we have multiple branches (i.e., loops or conditionals), we need to merge different variable versions together (denoted by the phi function).

|===

|Pseudocode |SSA form

a|Basic block:

----
a = 5
a = a + 10
print a
----

a|SSA Basic block:

----
a_0 = 5
a_1 = a_0 + 10
print a_1
----

a|Conditional

----
a = 5
if (a < 10) {
   a++
} else {
   a--
}
a = a * 2
print a
----

a|SSA conditional

----
a_0 = 5
if (a_0 < 10) {
   a_1 = a_0 + 1
} else {
   a_2 = a_0 - 1
}
a_3 = phi(a_1,a_2) * 2
print a_3
----

=== Garbage collection

Ah memory management. Regardless of how it happens, it must happen, unless you like leaking memory.

It helps to remember modern computer systems give us three kinds of memory:

* Static memory
* Stack memory
* Heap memory

Static memory is pretty straighforward: it's a chunk of memory that comes and goes with the program itself, and thus does not grow or shrink over the lifetime of the program.
Stack memory is managed using, ahem, a stack. (Who'da thunk it?)

When we think of memory management, we're almost certainly thinking about the heap: dynamically-allocated memory from the operating system with no pre-set lifespan.
Therefore, either the programmer has to specify when the memory is no longer needed, or we can rely on garbage collector to clean up after our mess.

Garbage collection algorithms must know the difference between pointer and an integer.
This is why C doesn't have it.
Just kidding, you can do garbage collection in C, but it must be *conservative*: it can't make guarantees that it collected all the garbage.

==== Reference counting
Strategy::
  Just count how many things point to this object, and when that count drops to 0, free the object.

Pros::
* Simple to implement
* Reasonably fast
* Reasonably good (if Python uses it, it must be somewhat good)

Cons::
* Now, every object has to have an extra integer just for the reference count.
* What happens when you got two objects pointing to each other (like in a circular linked list)? Crap! The reference count never drops to zero, that's what!

==== Tracing (Mark sweep) garbage collection
There's many variations of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection[tracing (mark-sweep) garbage collection].

Strategy::
. Maintain a root set (a set of objects reachable throughout the program and in the current scope of the program).
. Traverse (trace) the object graph starting from the root set, looking for garbage (objects unreachable from the root set)

Pros::
* This can deal properly with all garbage, including circular linked lists that nobody else references
* No space overhead of reference counts

Cons::
* Naive implementations are slow, and briefly hang programs
* Not what you'd use when precise timing is important (e.g., launching a rocket, autonomous cars)
* Essentially, this algorithm is what gave garbage collection its bad reputation

Naive mark sweep::
  Tracing garbage collection that runs when we're out of memory, and stops the program during garbage collection.

Concurrent/incremental mark sweep::
  The program still runs during GC (which happens in a separate thread), but marked objects are locked as necessary.

Generational::
Most objects on the heap are short-lived: they're dynamically allocated and freed almost right away.
Other objects, fewer in number, live long, productive and happy lives.
This form of GC moves reachable objects between two or more memory pools called generations, without touching garbage.

NOTE: Good compilers will optimize away as much heap allocation as possible using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_analysis[escape analysis], checking at compile time to see if an object could be referenced outside a function. If not, allocate on the stack.



== June 5: Symbol tables, type checking

Before we begin... http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/will-it-optimize.html[Will it optimize?]
http://www.malevole.com/mv/misc/killerquiz/[Programming language inventor or serial killer]?
Also, https://fatiherikli.github.io/programming-language-network/[The programming language network]

=== Symbol tables
A map among identifiers, scopes and other information (e.g., its type, where it's defined).

* In an interpreter, these can be used for data storage.
* In a compiler, these are used to generate code.

=== Type checking

Type checking ensures that no types are mismatched.

Strong vs. weak typing::
How rigidly types are enforced?
*Strongly-typed* languages enforce types rigidly (e.g., Haskell, Rust, Python).
*Weakly-typed* languages allow some implicit mismatched type coercion (e.g., PHP, C).

Dynamic vs. Static typing::
When does type-checking happen?
*Dynamically-typed* languages check type mismatches at run-time (e.g., Python, Ruby, Javascript).
*Statically-typed* languages check type mismatches at compile-time (e.g., Java, C++, Haskell), by
traversing (and decorating) the AST.

How to get this wrong: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/useing-youre-types-good[Useing you're types good]

=== Memory

Globals::
Memory that comes preallocated with the program (i.e., global constants or variables, the `data` area in assembly).

Stack::
Memory allocated on the stack frame (i.e., local variables in a function).
Deallocation happens on function exit.

Heap::
Dynamically-allocated memory (i.e., memory allocated with `new` or `malloc`).
Deallocation happens either manually with `delete` or `free`, or with a garbage collector.
http://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] tracks ownership in the type system, allowing the type checker to determine where to place deallocation code at compile time.

== June 4: Lab 4. Optimize Brainfuck

Optimize your compiler and interpreter developed in Lab 3.

. Modify +CommandNode+ so that it includes a counter (presumably an +int+ or the like).
. Modify the parser a bit so that it only emits a command node after it has encountered a full run of the same command. (e.g., +-----+ becomes +CommandNode(\'-', 5)+)
. Modify the interpreter and compiler accordingly.

In short: do an optimization that performs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding[run-length encoding] on Brainfuck code.

Then, optimize away certain loops (e.g., `[-]` or `[+]`) with a `CommandNode` to assign zero to the current memory location.

. Modify `Command` to include another command type: `ZERO`
. Modify the `CommandNode` constructor
. Either traverse through the tree with an Optimizer visitor to do replacements,
preprocess the input to replace `[-]` or `[+]` with new node types,
or in the recursive call to `parse`,  check the `Loop` that we get and emit the proper `CommandNode`

=== Hints

Use `peek` to check when to add a command node to the current container.

You can tell the optimizer is working if the code your compiler generates includes numeric literals, and the printer and interpreter still work.

Test out your old brainfuck interpreter on `src/99bottles.bf` and compare it with your optimized brainfuck interpreter. Is it faster?

== June 3: Optimizations

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler[There are many of them].

== June 1: Let's write a compiler (sorta)

=== Announcements

Lab 3 has a new test program, `echo.bf` that just prints out what you type when run.
`rot13.bf` may not actually work as advertised, derp.

Let's talk about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29[quines].
And https://github.com/mame/quine-relay[quine relays].

I added `quine.bf` to test lab 3 using the `is-lab-2-done.sh` script because I'm that lazy.

=== Preliminaries

----
git commit -am "WIP" # Commit your stuff if you need to
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/lab3
git mergetool # if you see a CONFLICT
----

=== Activity

. Copypasta the `Printer` visitor in `src/brainfuck.cpp`.
. Rename it to `Compiler`.
. Instead of printing out Brainfuck code, print out equivalent code for a different language.
For languages that need it (e.g., Java), pick a name for your program class (e.g., `Default`).

For example, in Java:

----
./brainfuck.exe echo.bf > Default.java # Translate brainfuck to java
javac Default.java # Compile translated Java code
java Default # Run translated Java bytecode (it should do what echo.bf does)
----

Done!

For example, to C:

----
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/brainfuck2c
git mergetool
cd src
g++ brainfuck.cpp -o brainfuck.exe
./brainfuck.exe echo.bf > echo.c # translate brainfuck to C
gcc echo.c -o myecho.exe
myecho.exe # The compiled executable form of echo.bf
----

== May 29: Parsing frameworks

NOTE: Read http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf[Read through chapter 5].

NOTE: In Lab 3, use `cin.get(mumble)` to read in a char, `cin >> mumble` ignores spaces.

=== Parser generators

A parser generator is a tool that takes a grammar specification in a file, and produces parse code.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators[There are many of them].
Each has severe limitations.
Since these require a grammar spec, you need to understand the grammar's grammar.

Here's one for Java. http://www.antlr.org/[ANTLR]

=== Parser combinators

There are many of them.

The parser code isn't a separate tool, it's a library you embed in your program.
So, you specify a grammar in your code, and let the library do the parse for you.

Examples: Spirit, Parsec

=== Inferring grammars from sequences

http://www.sequitur.info/jair[Sequitur algorithm]

== May 28: Lab 3. Interpreting Brainfuck

=== Preliminaries

Go ahead and fetch and merge from me (don't forget to commit your work first):

----
cd ~/COMP603-2015
git fetch upstream
# Unable to merge? Stage and commit your changes
git merge upstream/master
git merge upstream/lab3
# Have a CONFLICT?
git mergetool
----

Do you have Visual Studio or http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/Windows/codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe[Code Blocks] or XCode installed?
The starter code, `src/brainfuck.cpp`, is in `C++`.

=== Goal
Write an interpreter for Brainfuck (this builds on Lab 2).

=== Hints

The program works when it prints out `Hello World!` for `helloworld.bf`

Study `in-class/AST.java` to get an idea of what you'll need to do.

Or, try a program that takes in input, such as `echo.bf`.
If you type in `HELLO` (and press Enter), it will print: `HELLO`.

----
./brainfuck.exe echo.bf
HELLO
HELLO
----

== May 27: Tree traversal with visitors

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern[Visits?!? Well, that'd indicate visitors].

Pull from upstream and study `in-class/AST.java`. Play code golf.

== May 22: Moar hints & stuff

See updated lab description and hints below.

Also, your favorite language sucks, and here's why.

== May 21: Lab 2. Parsing Brainfuck

=== Preliminaries

Go ahead and pull from me:

----
cd ~/COMP603-2015
git pull upstream master
----

Do you have Visual Studio or http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/Windows/codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe[Code Blocks] or XCode installed?
The starter code, `src/brainfuck.cpp`, is in `C++`.

=== Goal

Modify `src/brainfuck.cpp` to parse http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck[Brainfuck] using recursive descent.
Brainfuck's LL(1) grammar is:

----
Program -> Sequence

Sequence -> Command Sequence
Sequence -> Loop Sequence
Sequence -> any other character, ignore (treat as a comment)
Sequence -> "" (empty string)

Command -> '+' | '-' | '<' | '>' | ',' | '.'

Loop -> '[' Sequence ']'
----

Brainfuck in EBNF is:

----
Program -> Sequence

Sequence -> ( Command | Loop | Comment ) *

Command -> '+' | '-' | '<' | '>' | ',' | '.'

Loop -> '[' Sequence ']'

Comment -> any character other than '+' | '-' | '<' | '>' | ',' | '.' | '[' | ']'
----

=== Hints

The parser will probably be no longer than 20-30 lines; the solution is shorter than the problem statement.
To read characters in a loop, `while(file >> c) { ... }`

If your `C++` is rusty, see the http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/[C++ Reference].

Write the recursive descent parser using any of these strategies:

. Write `parse` recursively.
. Use mutually recursive functions as done in `in-class/RecursiveDescent.java`.
For each nonterminal in the grammar, write a function with the name of the nonterminal.
Peek at the next character and figure out which production (rule) to apply based on the first and/or follow sets.
. Maintain an explicit stack of nodes inside the existing `parse` function.
. Use an implicit stack by modifying `Node` to include a pointer to a `parent` Node.

NOTE: Your parser *cannot* avoid using recursion or a stack (implicit or explicit). Don't even.

You are done if your program builds a tree structure *correctly*.
You need to place child nodes into the appropriate `Container`.
This means `Program` at the top-level, and inside a new `Loop` in the appropriate spots.

To check your implementation, use the `is-lab2-done.sh` script, or compare program output with input.
The program traverses the tree your parser built and prints it out with the `Printer` http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern[visitor].
If the program shows any discrepancy between the program output and input, it means your parser formed the tree improperly.
Of course, printing out the input file without forming a tree fools the script, but nobody else.

----
cd ~/COMP603-2015
cd src
g++ -o brainfuck.exe brainfuck.cpp
brainfuck.exe helloworld.bf
chmod +x is-lab2-done.sh
./is-lab2-done.sh
----

=== Deadline

Please complete before the next lab period. In the next lab, we'll write an interpreter for Brainfuck.

Modify `src/brainfuck.cpp` in place, or replace it with your version.

== May 20: Shift-reduce parsing LR(k) grammars

=== LR(k) grammars

LR(k) means *Left* to right, *Rightmost* derivation, with *k* tokens of lookahead.

LR(k) grammars are a subset of the context-free grammars, and a proper superset of the LL(k) grammars (the LL(k) grammars are a proper subset of the LR(k) grammars).
For a grammar to be LR(k):

* It must be unambiguous

LR(k) grammars can be parsed using 'shift-reduce'.

=== Shift-reduce parsing

Shift-reduce parsing is also known as bottom up parsing, because the parser works from the terminals up to the starting nonterminal.
A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uncfFsbUF68[shift-reduce parser] shifts terminals onto a stack, and reduces the stack to a nonterminal when the stack matches the right hand side of a production (rule).
Programmers rarely write shift-reduce parsers by hand, and use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_generator[parser generators] or parser combinators instead.

=== First and follow sets

First set:: the set of terminals (excluding empty string) that can appear first in any derivation of a nonterminal.
Follow set:: the set of terminals (ecluding empty string) that can appear first *after* derivation of a nonterminal.

=== LL(k) grammars

LL(k) means parse from *Left* to right, *Leftmost* derivation, with at most *k* tokens of lookahead.

LL(k) grammars are a subset of the context-free grammars. For a grammar to be LL(k):

* The first and follow sets for each nonterminal must be disjoint
* It must be unambiguous
* No left-recursion is allowed
* No common prefixes on the right hand side are allowed

LL(k) grammars can be parsed using 'recursive descent'.

=== Recursive descent parsing

Recursive descent parsing is also known as top-down parsing, because the parse starts from the starting nonterminal.
Each nonterminal is a function, and the first and follow sets determine which production (rule) to choose.
See `in-class/RecursiveDescent.java` for an example recursive descent parser.

== May 15: Derivations and parsing

*Challenge*: What's the parse tree for `int a = 5;` using the http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/CGrammar.pdf[C Grammar]?

== May 13: Chomsky, Derivatives, Compilers and Visitors, oh my!

=== Chomsky again

The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of languages.
Restrictions placed on grammar production rules
(or the underlying automaton) distinguish among language categories.

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/scribbles/chomsky-hierarchy.png[Chomsky hierarchy]

[cols="3", options="header"]
|===

|Language category
|Restrictions on grammar productions
|Equivalent automaton

|*Recursively-enumerable*
|*None*. Sequences of terminals and non-terminals may derive sequences of terminals and nonterminals.
|Finite automaton with infinite tape (Turing machine)

|*Context-sensitive*
|The same *context* (terminals or nonterminals) surrounds both sides of the nonterminal on the left, and the derivation on the right.
|Finite automaton with finite tape (Linearly-bounded Turing machine)

|*Context-free*
|A nonterminal derives sequences of terminals and nonterminals.
|Finite automaton with a stack (Pushdown automaton)

|*LR*
|Context-free but *forbids ambiguity*.
|Shift-reduce (bottom up) parser

|*LL*
|Context-free, the first and follow sets are disjoint, and forbids: ambiguity, left-recursion, and common prefixes.
|Recursive descent (top down) parser

|*Regular*
|A nonterminal may derive either terminals followed by a single nonterminal, or the empty string.
|Finite automaton

|*Finite*
|A nonterminal may derive terminals or the empty string.
|Finite automaton without cycles.

|===

=== Derivatives

http://matt.might.net/articles/parsing-with-derivatives/[A discussion of derivatives and parsing with them].

=== Compilers

Compilers consist of these 'phases':

[cols="4", options="header"]
|===
|Phase
|Description
|Input
|Output

|*Scan / Tokenize / Lexical analysis*
|Split source code into small chunks (tokens) such as identifiers, reserved words, literals, operators, etc.
|Source code
|Token stream

|*Parse*
|Check the syntax of the source code
|Token stream
|Parse tree

|*Translate*
|Translate low level syntax into high-level abstract syntax tree
|Parse tree
|Abstract syntax tree, symbol table

|*Optimize*
|Improve performance or structure
|Abstract syntax tree, symbol table
|Abstract synatx tree, symbol table

|*Generate code*
|Traverse the AST to generate code.
|Abstract syntax tree, symbol table
|Target code

|===

The *front-end* of a compiler consists of scanning and parsing;
the *back-end* consists of translation, optimization and code generation.

=== Visitors

Visitors visit (traverse) nodes in a tree to do some computation,
without mixing computation into the nodes themselves.

=== Challenge

Challenge: What's the parse tree for `int a = 5;` using the C Grammar?

== May 11: Regexes and Grammars

Cheat at http://puzzles.usatoday.com/[today's crossword puzzle],
the easy way with regexes!

----
cd ~/COMP603-2015
git pull upstream master
grep -E "^regex-goes-here$" american-english.txt
----

A *regular expression* (regex) defines a language with these primitives and operators.

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Notation |Meaning

|*Primitives*
|
|Regular expression building block.

|*Empty Set*
|{}
|Reject everything.

|*Empty String*
|+""+
|Match the empty string.

|*Symbol*
|`a`
|Match a single character.

|*Operator*
|
|Make a new regex from existing regexes.

|*Sequence*
|`ab`
|Match regex `a` followed by regex `b`.

|*Alternation*
|`a\|b`
|Match regex `a` or match regex `b`, but not both.

|*Kleene Star*
|`a*`
|Match regex `a` zero or more times {+""+,`a`,`aa`,`aaa`,...}

|===

The primitives and operators above are *complete*:
we can define other regular expression operators in terms of them.
For example, `a?` optionally matches `a`; `a? = a|""`.
Another example: `a+` matches `a` 1 or more times; `a+ = a*a`.

Trivially, finite languages are regular:

----
finite language:  {"hello","cruel","world"}
equivalent regex: hello|cruel|world
----

Since regular languages can be infinite, they encompass the finite languages.

----
.* (Matches everything)
----

Regular languages can't express everything; 
for example, they cannot check matching brackets in the general case.
Hence, the other classes of languages.

The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of languages.
What distinguishes one language category from another is
restrictions placed on grammars or the underlying automaton.

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/scribbles/chomsky-hierarchy.png[Chomsky hierarchy]

A *grammar* consists of a finite set of nonterminals (variables),
a starting nonterminal, terminals (literals, words or symbols),
and productions (rules) that map among terminals and nonterminals.
Grammars define languages: they generate the set of strings in the language
and test membership of a string in the language.

The example grammar below defines a small subset of English, with an example sentence.
The example grammar is context-free because the left side of each arrow is a nonterminal.

=== What is the difference between a set, a bag, and a sequence?

These are all collections.

A *set* is unordered and has no duplicates (no repeated values).

----
{ "hello", "world" } == { "world", "hello" }

A *bag* is unordered and allows duplicates (repeated values).

A *sequence* is ordered and allows duplicates.

----
[ "hello", "cruel", "world" ] != [ "cruel", "world", "hello" ]

=== What is a language in terms of sets and sequences?

English subset

----
{
    "This is a sentence in English.",
    "This is another sentence in English."
}
----

Espanol subseto?

----
{
    "Yo quiero Taco Bell",
    "Donde esta el bano?"
}
----

An *alphabet* is a set of symbols (e.g., `char`).
A *string* is a sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet.

*Languages* are (possibly infinite) sets of strings.
A *grammar* constructs a language; *regular expressions* construct *regular* languages.

=== What is a compiler? Name some.

A *compiler* transforms source language into a target language.

javac, gcc, clang, etc.

=== What is an interpreter? How does that differ from a compiler?

An *interpreter* accepts code and runtime data and runs with it.
We're not generating code.
